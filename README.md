How To Play:

The objective of the game is to repeat the sequence of colors and tones generated by the console for as many rounds as possible.

Click the "Start" button to begin the game. The console will generate a sequence of colors and tones, starting with one color.

Each round, the console will display the current round number briefly.

The console will then display a sequence of colors and tones, adding one color to the sequence each round. Pay close attention to the sequence as it is displayed.

After the sequence is displayed, it's your turn. Click on the colors in the same order as the sequence displayed by the console.

If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game proceeds to the next round, and the console adds another color to the sequence. Your score increases by one point for each correct sequence.

If you make a mistake and click on the wrong color or in the wrong order, the game ends.

Your highest score achieved is displayed at the top. Try to beat your previous high score!

If the game ends, you can click the "Try Again" button to restart the game and try to beat your high score.
